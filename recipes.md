//steps for making a souffle omellete

1. Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Toss the cauliflower florets and smaller leaves with the oil and spread over a large baking tray. 

2. Meanwhile, make the cheese sauce. Mix the crème fraîche, mustard, 1 egg yolk (reserve the egg white) and cheese in a small saucepan.

3. Separate the remaining eggs and place the whites (including the reserved white) in a medium bowl.

4. Whisk for 2-3 mins until they triple in size and have soft peaks. Place the yolks in a separate, large bowl and whisk until pale and thick.

5. Carefully add one-third of the whites to the yolks and gently stir with a large metal spoon until combined and looser in consistency.

6. Next, melt the butter in a large (about 25cm) nonstick, lidded frying pan over a medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture, lightly spread with a spatula to evenly cover the base of the pan, then season and cover with the lid. Cook for 4-5 mins until the bottom of the omelette is golden and set and the top is pale but lightly set.
